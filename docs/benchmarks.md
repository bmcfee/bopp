Benchmarks
==========

In this section, we'll compare loading and validating annotations between different
serialization formats for BOPP, as well as JAMS (with and without validation) as a baseline
reference.
Comparisons to direct CSV loading via pandas (`pd`) and polars (`pl`) are also included.
The BOPP CSV reader uses polars by default with subsequent decoding and schema validation checks.

All comparisons are implemented on the author's development machine (intel core i7-1360P, 32GB
ram, ubuntu 26.04.01-LTS, python 3.13.0 conda).

Running time is calculated by `pytest-benchmark` with code in `tests/benchmark.py` and
configuration in `pyproject.toml`.

Beats
-----
1200 observations, synthesized as a 10-minute annotation at 120BPM.

Extents are time values in seconds, payloads are integer-valued.

```{include} benchmarks/longbeats.md
```

Chords
------
Chord estimates of *The Beatles - Drive My Car* as produced by the CREMA model; 87 observed,
disjoint time intervals.

Extents are time intervals in seconds, payloads are chord strings under the Harte grammar,
likelihoods are probabilities (floats in `[0, 1]`).
